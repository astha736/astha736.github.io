Locomotion in real-world environments is particularly challenging for robots due to the unpredictable and dynamic nature of these settings. Unlike controlled laboratory conditions, real-world terrains vary in texture, slope, and stability, requiring robots to navigate uneven surfaces, obstacles, and changes in elevation. Environmental factors such as weather, debris, and interactions with other entities add further complexity. Stability and reliability in robotic locomotion require robust fault tolerance, as events like lesions, perturbations, and sensor failures are inevitable and significantly impact locomotion. While animals exhibit remarkable robustness to such disruptions, allowing them to recover and continue their tasks, robots must achieve similar resilience, especially in high-stakes scenarios like search and rescue. My research, inspired by the robustness seen in animals, investigates enhancing robot locomotion through sensory-motor integration, Central Pattern Generators (CPGs), and morphological adaptation.

<!-- Understanding sensorimotor integration is pivotal in tackling real-world environments because it equips robots with the ability to process sensory information and execute coordinated movements seamlessly. This integration enables robots to perceive their surroundings accurately through sensors, such as cameras and LIDAR, and to interpret this data to make informed decisions about movement and interaction. By mimicking the way biological systems adjust their actions based on sensory feedback, robots can adapt to unexpected changes in their environment, navigate complex terrains, and perform tasks with precision. This capability is essential for applications in unpredictable settings, such as search and rescue operations, autonomous driving, and agricultural automation, where robots must respond to dynamic conditions and obstacles. Ultimately, sensorimotor integration fosters greater autonomy and reliability in robots, enhancing their effectiveness and versatility in real-world applications. -->
